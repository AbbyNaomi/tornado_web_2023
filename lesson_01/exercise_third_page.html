        <h1>Welcome to My Exercise Plan!</h1>
        <p>Are you ready to get started on your fitness journey?
            This simple exercise plan will help you build a foundation
            for a healthier and more active lifestyle.</p>
            <h2><strong>Day 1:</strong> Walking
            </h2>
            <p>Start with a 15-minute brisk walk around your neighborhood
                or a nearby park. Focus on maintaining good posture and breathing rhythmically.</p>
<h2><strong>Day 2:</strong> Stretching
</h2>
<p>Perform a 10-minute stretching routine to improve flexibility.
Include stretches for your neck, shoulders, arms, legs, and back.</p>
<h2><strong>Day 3:</strong> Squats
</h2>
<p>Do 3 sets of 10 squats. Squats are great for building lower body strength.
    Keep your back straight, and go as low as you comfortably can.</p>
    <h2><strong>Day 4:</strong> Rest
    </h2>
<p>Rest is essential for muscle recovery. Take a break today and focus on staying hydrated.</p>
<h2><strong>Day 5:</strong> Push-ups
</h2>
<p>Perform 3 sets of 5 push-ups. If regular push-ups are too challenging,
    start with knee push-ups and work your way up.</p>
<h2><strong>Day 6:</strong> Jumping Jacks
</h2>
<p>Do 3 sets of 15 jumping jacks. This is a great way to improve cardiovascular
    fitness and burn calories.</p>
<h2><strong>Day 7:</strong> Rest
</h2>
<p>Another day of rest to allow your body to recover. Focus on healthy eating
    and staying active by walking or stretching.</p>
    <h2><strong>Remember:</strong>
    </h2>
<p>Stay hydrated throughout your workouts.
    Listen to your body; don't push too hard, especially if you're just starting out.
    Consistency is key. Try to stick to your exercise plan and
    gradually increase intensity as you become more comfortable.
    Consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any
    new exercise program, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.</p>
